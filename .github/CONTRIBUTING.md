# Contributing

This doc has some guidelines on how to generate and contribute to this library.

## Generate

Currently this library is generated by hand using quicktype using the web UI: https://app.quicktype.io/.
This is done for validating that quicktype is the right tool for generating types.

The manual process is:

- Generate or get JSON payload examples for a specific event
- Use the web UI with **Source type** of `Multiple JSON`
- Add the generated TS file in the event type folder with the name `index.ts`
- Add the following line to provide a JS function for casing an object to the type, replacing `MyData` with the data message type:
    ```ts
    export const toMyData = (json: object) => {
        return json as MyData;
    };
    ```

This issue tracks automating this process: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloudevents-nodejs/issues/20

## Publish

This module is automatically published by [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) when merging a generated release PR.
This PR is created from a GitHub Action that detects changes to the `master` branch.

Sometimes publishing does not work. To publish manually, Googlers can run the following commands:

```sh
npm login --registry https://wombat-dressing-room.appspot.com
npm publish --registry https://wombat-dressing-room.appspot.com
```

### Conventional Commit Requirement

Only `feat` and `fix` or any commit that's breaking, as indicated by a `!`: `refactor!: foo` will trigger a release. Other commits will not trigger a PR from the bot.
