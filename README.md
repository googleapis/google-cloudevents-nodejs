# Google CloudEvents â€“ Node.js [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40google%2Fevents.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/events) [![github ci](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloudevents-nodejs/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloudevents-nodejs/actions?query=workflow%3Aci)

This repository contains types for CloudEvents issued by Google.

## Prerequisites

- Node 10 (or higher)

## Install

```sh
npm i @google/events
```

## Examples

- [TypeScript examples](./examples/typescript.ts)

## Generate

Currently this library is generated by hand using quicktype using the web UI: https://app.quicktype.io/.
This is done for validating that quicktype is the right tool for generating types.

The manual process is:

- Generate or get JSON payload examples for a specific event
- Use the web UI with **Source type** of `Multiple JSON`
- Add the generated TS file in the event type folder with the name `index.ts`
- Add the following line to provide a JS function for casing an object to the type, replacing `MyData` with the data message type:
    ```ts
    export const toMyData = (json: object) => {
        return json as MyData;
    };
    ```

This issue tracks automating this process: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloudevents-nodejs/issues/20
